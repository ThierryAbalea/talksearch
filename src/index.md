As conference organizers, we spend a lot of time and effort making sure our
event will bring value to the audience. We hand-pick speakers with great content
and we love when people share their knowledge to make everyone a better
developer.

That's why we record the talks, so we can then share them with people that could
not attend in the first place. But that's hours and hours of content. Surely
there is a better way to make this content discoverable?

That's why we built TalkSearch. TalkSearch will allow your visitors to browse
all your talks and search for any topic they're interested in. It will even
search into what the speakers are actually _saying_ and jump right to the
matching moment in the video.
