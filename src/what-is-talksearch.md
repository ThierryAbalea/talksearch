title: What is TalkSearch?
---

TalkSearch.js is a UI helper to help you build a search interface to
display your TalkSearch records. If you don't yet have TalkSearch index for
your conference, you should contact community@algolia.com to get you started.

With TalkSearch, you have access to an Algolia index containing all your videos
data. As with any other Algolia index, you can build your own search UI on top
of it by using our InstantSearch.js library. This library contains a set of
widgets (searchbar, results, filters, pagination, etc) that you can combine and
configure to build your unique UI.

To make things easier, we packaged some default templating into TalkSearch.js.
This will give you a head start and make the initial integration much faster;
you should be able to have a working search in your website in a matter of
minutes.

_Note that you __don't have to__ use TalkSearch.js to use your TalkSearch index. It
makes the initial integration smoother, especially if you don't yet have
experience with InstantSearch.js and Algolia in general, but it is not
mandatory. See the Custom Template section for more information._
